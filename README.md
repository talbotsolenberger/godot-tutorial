# What is this?
This is a tutorial for Godot that I've made for my wife and my brother to learn the very basics of what I do with my time in this engine.

This tutorial is meant to be an incredibly surface level look at the Godot editor. It will show the user what a script is, how to run a project, and what nodes are. That's it.The tutorial works this way because it's meant to be a look at the engine from the perspective of someone who isn't going to use Godot. When the person who uses this tutorial later talks to their friend or family that made them do the tutorial about what they're working on next, they will have just enough understanding to ask follow-up questions like "oh, is X a type of node?" or "Oh, you had to get X and Y to talk to each other?" 

This is NOT meant to be a tutorial for how to USE Godot. I highly recommend taking a look at [Brackeys](https://www.youtube.com/@Brackeys) on youtube for tutorials on the basics of using Godot to make games. This tutorial will not teach the basics of GDScript or using the vast majority of the necessary features of Godot.

# How to use this tutorial
Clone this repository and open the project in Godot.

In the bottom left corner of the screen, you will see the FileSystem window. Inside the `lesson_1` folder, double click both `lesson_1.tscn` and `lesson_1.gd`.

At the top center of the engine, you will see labels that say 2d, 3d, Script, Game, and AssetLib. If Script is not already selected, click that. That will enable you to see the lesson text that is in `lesson_1.gd`.

Follow the instructions in the lesson. When prompted to move on to the next lesson, double click the `.tscn` and `.gd` file in the appropriate `lesson` folder.
