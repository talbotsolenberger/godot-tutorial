# Lesson 7 - Conclusion
#
# It may surprise you that the tutorial ends here. This tutorial was meant to 
# be only the most cursory of overviews of the engine. If anything was ever
# "in the weeds" about any specific topic, it was cut from this tutorial. 
#
# What wasn't covered was the majority of actually building anything in Godot.
# An overview of what "building blocks" a developer uses in Godot, scripts 
# and nodes, is all that we thought was necessary at this level.
#
# To build anything in Godot involves learning the fundamentals of programming
# as well as learning what many different nodes are capable of. To begin 
# building a game in Godot, we highly recommend checking out Brackey's videos 
# on the topic on youtube.
