# Lesson 2 - Writing Code
#
# In this lesson, you are going to write some code! You are going to do what
# all new programmers do and say hello to the world. To do this, you are going
# to use the `print()` function. Let's see it in action first. Press Play 
# and see what pops up in the box at the bottom of the screen.
#
# Take a look at the code below, there are a few things to take note of. 
# First is the _ready() function. Any code inside this function, as designated
# by being indented under it, will run a single time as soon as you press play.
#
# Secondly is the print() function. Notice that anything placed in double 
# quotes inside the parenthesis will be output in the box when you press play.
#
# Your job is to use print() to say Hello World in the output box. When you're
# ready, delete the existing print() line and write your code below the line.
# When you've succeeded in making the box say Hello World, proceed to the next
# lesson.

func _ready():
	# PLACE ALL CODE BELOW THIS LINE ---------------------------------------- #
	print("I'm using the print() function!")
